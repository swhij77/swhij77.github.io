                <h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
                <p>According to Executive Yuan of Taiwan, charity donation in 2013 is estimated as 537 billion NTD
                (53,700,000,000). It is safe to describe Taiwanese poeple are very generous when it comes to helping other people in difficult times. However, charity scandals are often reported from time to time these years. Where does the donation go? How does the donation help people? Are the resources controled by "major" charity organization? These question started to catch our attention. As a  contributor, I wanted to come up with a new solution to improve this situation.  </p>

                <h3>Understanding our users and painpoints</h3>
                <p>How to make the minority group visible in public eyes and how to make the resources distribute more properly is what I considered at first as I began the project. I wanted to understand how charity works under current system, hence I made the appointment with employees at Rare Disease Organization and  Shin-Lu Social Welfare Foundation to get a better perspective of social worker’s point of view. I found out their daily work is very detailed and very time consuming.</p>
                <p>Next, I interviewed with people who has contributed in the past. They usually have their own cause and purpose to participate in charity. At the same time, they tend to have doubt in charity organization. Why people want to help others that they don’t know is also a crucial lead in my research.</p> 
                <p>With this in mind, I designed an app specifically for potential contributors to ease their doubt and make them willing to come back. Throughout the process, I learned the difficulties in designing platform since there is always two sides of target audience that need to be considered. Furthermore, how to create a trust machinism is also what I struggle the most in the design process.</p></br>

<!--What is our purpose?
Pemory is a concept app designed for current or expectant pet owners. Our goal is to help users to solve the pet related problems they may encounter in their life and prevent pet owners from giving up their pets easily.


Audience
In Taiwan, the changes in living environment or living condition is the most common reason why people give up pets. The changes can be very diverse, including moving, having newborn babies, or breaking up. Another common reason is that the living needs of pets go beyond the owners’ expectations.
But, why do people think giving up animals is the only possible solution? We found out that most people regard pets as property.

When a tool is not useful or no longer needed, we can always throw it away. However, pets are not tools. They provide us unconditional love. On the first day they come to our home, they are already our family. We never abandon our kids, so why abandon our pets?

With this in mind, we designed an app specifically for current or expectant pet owners to
remind them that pets are our dearest family, and encourage them to interact with their pets and keep all the beautiful moments with pets, just like what they do with family. Furthermore, we try to help pet owners to solve pet-related problems they may face in their life.

FEATURES & SOLUTIONS

Design - Matching
‘Matching’ is a function which provides a simple quiz for anyone looking for the perfect pet for themselves. It does this by asking users to answer some questions about their lifestyle, residential environment, family members, personality, and preference. Based on these answers, the system will match them with the right pets for adoption. It also offers tips and guidelines for new pet owners to help them step by step to get ready for pet ownership.

Design - Archiving 
This function helps users to record all the incredible moments and sweet memories with their pets anytime and anywhere. For example, they can write down interesting things and take photos while taking a walk with their pets. And all the records will be archived on their personal page. This motivates users to interact with and create more special memories with their pets by providing a variety of special badges. It helps users to establish a close relationship with their pets.

Design - Sharing
A social function provides users a platform to share every precious moment they spend with their pets with pet lovers around the world. They can exchange their funny stories and experiences anytime. When they encounter pet-related problems, they can simply ask other owners for help. Users can also get useful information such as pet-friendly restaurants or nearby pet hospitals.
